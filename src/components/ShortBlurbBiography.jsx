        I love traveling internationally. There's something magical about being on the road — hopping between cities, wandering through landmarks, and people-watching from a café window on a busy street. Every trip leaves behind memories that make each year feel richer and more colorful. Even the logistics — visas, itineraries, endless checklists — feel worthwhile because the anticipation is part of the adventure.

        I keep a map covered in travel pins and photo albums filled with printed memories. Watching both of them fill up over time is deeply rewarding — a visual record of my life's journeys. So far, I've been to all seven continents and both polar regions, where I also discovered my passion for wildlife photography.

        Beyond travel, I love learning new things. Mastering new skills keeps me curious, grounded, and inspired. I'm an Advanced PADI-certified scuba diver currently working toward becoming a Scuba Master, exploring the hidden beauty of the underwater world. I'm also training to become a recreational pilot and getting licensed for skydiving — chasing both freedom and adrenaline in the skies.

        I used to ski, but lately I've switched to snowboarding. I still fall more often than I'd like, but every lesson gets me a little closer to carving down those mountains with ease. For me, every skill, every journey, is a new way to explore — the world, and myself.
