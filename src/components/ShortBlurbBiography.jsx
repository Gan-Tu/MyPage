        I love traveling internationally. It's a magical feeling to be on the
        road, hopping between tourist attractions and destinations, touring new
        cities and places, people-watching while sitting in front of a coffee
        shop window near a busy street. It creates wonderful memories, giving
        each year something to look back on and remember. It also brings
        something exciting to look forward to each year. Even the process of
        making travel plans is exciting, despite the headache it takes to prep
        for visas and itineraries. I put a pin on the map for each place I have
        visited, and I print all my travel photos out in a photo album. It's a
        rewarding experience to see maps getting fuller and fuller with little
        travel pins, and the photo albums getting filled up. It's my life's
        journeys and experiences recorded in snapshots.

        I also enjoy learning new things and skills. It keeps me intellectually
        stimulated and engaged. The feeling of mastering and learning something
        new is gratifying, and it helps grow my passion and diversify my
        hobbies. I like adventures as well. I am an Advanced PADI-certified
        scuba diver, and I am working towards becoming a Scuba Master. It gives
        me the opportunity to explore amazingly unique places under the water. I
        am also studying to become a recreational pilot, as well as getting
        licensed for skydiving. This gives me the freedom to explore the sky,
        with the ability to experience extreme thrills and fun. I used to ski,
        but now I have started learning snowboarding. I still fall a lot, but
        with more lessons and practice, I look forward to the days where I can
        comfortably enjoy and traverse the beautiful snowy mountains.
