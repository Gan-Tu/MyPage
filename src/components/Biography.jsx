        Some people know me as a technical geek, while others know me as a
        passionate graphic designer. In my view, a beautiful design not only
        makes your products shine and appear ultra-high quality but also makes
        it incredibly satisfying to use. Thus, I consider my artistic talents
        really make me stand out from the classic Silicon Valley techie
        stereotypes.

        When I was small, I didn't know what I wanted to do, like many other
        kids. In my junior year when I applied for college, I applied to many
        architecture programs under the career influence of my dad. In fact, 18
        out of 20 degrees were in architecture. However, once I got into some
        prestigious programs with scholarships and even put down a student
        enrollment deposit, I decided to drop architecture and switch to
        business and finance because architecture is not really a fitting career
        for staying and working in the USA.

        At the time, I switched to a business and finance degree, thinking I was
        going to become either a consultant or an investment banker. I would
        participate in consulting and investment banking competitions.
        Nevertheless, I am not a person who likes to wait when I have
        intellectual cravings for learning. I began taking online business
        specialization programs from schools like Wharton and Harvard Business
        School. By the time I was a sophomore, I had taken an astonishing 1000+
        hours of online courses in various subjects and obtained 13+
        specializations. That made the undergraduate business degree boring and
        redundant for me, so I switched once again to a computer science major.

        This time, I fell in love. Different from my childhood experience
        learning competition-oriented programming classes in China, the schools
        actually made computer science fun and really enjoyable. Coupled with
        amazing professors from Stanford and Berkeley, I focused on CS full time
        and even finished all the graduate classes I wanted to take. What's
        really cool is I am really good. Yes, I have no shame but am proud in
        stating that I am really good at programming. In school, I also met some
        amazingly talented classmates in AI and ML as a part of the leadership
        team for Machine Learning at Berkeley, and that's where and how I got
        most of my AI knowledge and experience.

        To satisfy my intellectual endeavors, I spent my first college summer in
        Europe doing an entrepreneurship accelerator program. For my second
        summer, I attended an art school and learned graphic design, product
        design, transportation design, and 3D designs. It was three months of
        intensive drawing. For my last summer, I spent a whole year doing a
        co-op at Apple working on Siri and AI. Once I was back at school to
        finish my degree, I also audited various courses in Law School,
        including but not limited to Contract Law, Constitutional Law, Business
        Law - Negligence and Torts, and Criminal Law. As you can see, I really
        like to learn new things.

        Besides work, I love traveling. I have solo traveled to all 7
        continents, 26 countries and counting. It's my goal to travel to a
        different country each year, and I am gratful for having the time and
        means to make those memories. I am also a recreational scuba diver,
        working on my pilot's license, and trying to get better at both skiing
        and snowboarding.
